## Why this is an Issue

Open Source Software has become increasingly popular among many people and businesses across the world. However, a lot of different issues can arise from using Open Source Software. Licensing is one major component of Open Source Software without knowing the licenses that are associated with a particular piece of software, you cannot know what your are allowed to do with it. This becomes a large issue especially if you are running a rather large business. 

Another big issue when using Open Source Software are the vulnerabilities associated with a specific piece of sostare. If the software you are using is vulnerable to a lot of different things it might be a good idea to take a look at those vulnerabilities and try to address them before releasing your product. This issue can be easily seen when it comes to things you use everyday or even medical devices. If the software in your car or medical device uses open source software then it could potentially be vulnerable to different attacks that could cause a life threatening situation. Knowing the specific vulnerabilites on that software could prevent these type of things from occuring.
